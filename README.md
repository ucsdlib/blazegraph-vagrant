# Blazegraph Vagrant
This repository creates a Vagrant VM that bundles the [Blazegraph](https://www.blazegraph.com/) triplestore and related dependencies.

## Requirements

* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

## Usage

1. clone this repository
2. `cd blazegraph-vagrant`
3. `vagrant up` (and be patient)

Then login and start blazegraph:

```
$ vagrant ssh -- '/vagrant/downloads/BLAZEGRAPH_RELEASE_2_1_4/scripts/startBlazegraph.sh'
```

There are several scripts to start blazegraph, i.e.
```
scripts/startBigdata.sh
scripts/startBlazegraph.sh
scripts/startDebug.sh
```

Use the GNU Screen utility to start blazegraph in a persistent shell that can be detached and left to run while exiting from the VM.  (There may be other ways to run blazegraph as a daemon on VM startup - if you discover it, please note the solution in a new github issue.  It's likely something to do with installing Apache Tomcat or JBoss container servers and using a blazegraph WAR build.)

## Environment

* Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit machine
* [Blazegraph 2.1.4](https://github.com/blazegraph/database.git) at [http://localhost:9999/bigdata/](http://localhost:9999/bigdata/)

## Thanks

* This VM setup was heavily influenced (read: stolen) from [Fedora 4 Vagrant](https://github.com/fcrepo4-exts/fcrepo4-vagrant).
* The initial content and inspiration for this repository is taken from the [SPARQL Workshop](https://github.com/LODLAM/DLF15LODLAM/tree/master/SPARQL) given by [Tom Johnson](https://github.com/no-reply) at the DLF LODLAM meeting in 2015.
